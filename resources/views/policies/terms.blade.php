                                        <h3>Copyright Infringement</h3>
                                        <p>Pursuant to our rights under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), 17 U.S.C. ยง512, we have designated a copyright agent to receive copyright infringement notices for claims of infringement related to materials found on this Website. Our copyright agent is Alex Torrenegra. The agent can be reached at: <a href="mailto:support@xxxxx.com">support@xxxx.com</a>.</p>
                                        <h3>DMCA Infringement Notification</h3>
                                        <p>To be effective, infringement notifications sent to our copyright agent must include the following:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
                                            <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</li>
                                            <li>Identification of the material or content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or have access disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;</li>
                                            <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, including address, telephone number and email address where the complaining party may be contacted;</li>
                                            <li>The following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law"; and</li>
                                            <li>The following statement: "The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner or that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Upon receipt of the written notification containing the information as outlined in 1 through 6 above:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>We will remove or disable access to the content that is alleged to be infringing;</li>
                                            <li>We will forward the written notification to the alleged infringer; and</li>
                                            <li>We will take reasonable steps to promptly notify the alleged infringer that we have removed or disabled access to the content.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <h3>DMCA Infringement Counter Notification</h3>
                                        <p>Pursuant to the DMCA, after the alleged infringer receives a notice of infringement from us, the alleged infringer will have the opportunity to respond to us with a counter notification ("Counter Notification"). To be effective, a Counter Notification must be a written communication provided to our copyright agent, and must include the following:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;</li>
                                            <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access disabled;</li>
                                            <li>The following statement: "I swear under penalty of perjury that it is my good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled"; and</li>
                                            <li>The alleged infringer's name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the alleged infringer consents to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which the subscriber's address is located, or if the subscriber's address is outside of the United States, any judicial district in which we may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Upon the copyright agent's receipt of a Counter Notification containing the information as outlined in 1 through 4 above, the DMCA provides that the removed material will be restored or access re-enabled. We will comply with this requirement as required by law, provided that our copyright agent has not received notice from the original complaining party that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our network.</p>
